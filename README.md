The current project I'm working on is a recipe website. It's designed to showcase a variety of delicious dishes along with their recipes and cooking instructions. The main focus is on providing clear, easy-to-follow steps for users to recreate these dishes at home.

By the time I complete this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in HTML, the foundational language of web development. Specifically, I will have honed my skills in structuring web pages effectively, organizing content logically, and ensuring accessibility and usability for users navigating the site. These skills are crucial for building any functional and user-friendly website, including this recipe platform.
